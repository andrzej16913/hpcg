File fpga.hpp contains constants necessary for compilation for FPGA.
CG.cpp and other computation functions were copied into new file fpga.cpp,
which contains main kernel.
Preparing and running kernel happens in new file caller.cpp.

Makefile was copied and edited manually to make FPGA compilation possible.
New target Make.FPGA was also created and special variables were defined.

For now, only whole kernel runtime is measured.
